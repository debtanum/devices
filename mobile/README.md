# Devices Mobile App

This is a minimal React Native project for Android and iOS.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have the React Native CLI installed.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Use `npm run android` or `npm run ios` to launch the app on a device or emulator.

The main entry point is `App.js` which currently renders a simple greeting.
